　[size=175]🚛 [b]When can I get my cards?[/b][/size]
   [quote][list]Usually designer requires a week or more to finish all of the request, upload the files, and distribute the cards one by one to each requester.

      Since it was taking too much of the designers' time to deliver the cards by themselves, we facilitated by adding a new subsection: card deliverer.

      However, in some cases, the designer cannot finish it in a week and probably will take months to complete due to works they need to finish first.

      Note that most of our club staff are teenagers and undergraduate students, and we focus more on our education.[/list][/quote]
