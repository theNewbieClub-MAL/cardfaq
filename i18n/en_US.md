# About: Cards

## 💳 What is card?

**Cards** or **card editions** are a club thing that don’t serve a real purpose, but are rather
collectibles that you can, for example, just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this
example here, or display them in your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

We don't have a definite answer on how it became a thing but it's in a lot of other clubs as well.
This is just one of them.

Graphic designers use programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Krita, GIMP, and Paint.NET (or any editing
program<!-- including Microsoft PowerPoint :o-->) to make cards.

Members collect them for these vary reasons:

1. Show off in a blog.
2. The sake of having a collection.
3. Admire the cards made by different designers.

The card design you will get is same as what you requested with your username in
it.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
