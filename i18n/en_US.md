# About: Cards

## 💳 What is card?

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/job_illustrator_pc_man.png" align="right" width="200">

**Cards** or **card editions** are a club thing that don’t serve a real purpose, but are rather
collectibles that you can, for example, just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this
example here, or display them in your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

We don't have a definite answer on how it became a thing but it's in a lot of other clubs as well.
This is just one of them.

Members collect them for these reasons:

1. Show off in a blog.
2. The sake of having a collection.
3. Admire the cards made by different designers.

The card design you will get is same as what you requested with your username in
it.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

## ✉️ How to get the cards?
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
Requesting an card is easy by following this step:

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/computer_mail.png" align="right" width="200">

* **Check if the edition still open.**
  > You can check it by looking up thread title. If it says `[CLOSED]` or `[HALTED]`, then you're
  > out of luck. ;-;
* **Read carefully the instruction and rules included on the edition.**
  > These instructions will assist you on how to request the cards while abiding rules.
1. Copy the form provided on the edition thread.
   > In some cases, user required to **not modify** the template at all.
2. Go to the bottom/top of thread, and look for "Post New Reply" or "Quick Reply" button/link, and
   click it to reply.
3. Paste the form to the text box, and fill the form based what the instruction suggests.
   > Make sure total amount cards you requested for each staff is not exceeded from limit specified.
4. Submit the request.
5. You're done!

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 -->

## ❓ What are those random text inside brackets?

Those are known as BBCode tags. Simply saying, those are instructions to tell MyAnimeList which text
we want to format.

For example, if we want to make the text **bold**, we can do it by typing:

```as
[b]bold[/b]
```

You can learn more about BBCode from:

* [The Newbie Club BBCode Guide][tncBBCode]
* [MyAnimeList's Official Formatting Tips][malBBCode]
* [Shishio's BBCode Guide (with Video)][shishioBBCode]

## 🤔 Can I remove some "questions" on the forms?

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/dame_man.png" align="left" width="125">

Short answer, **no**.

All of those questions, excluding comments, suggestion, and feedback (if any),
are required in request form.

In The Newbie Club, the structure must stay as if, due to implementation on bot.

However, you can leave it blank as to avoid any conflict.

## ↩️ Can I get cards from previous edition?

**No**. It is not possible to get previous edition's cards, UNLESS if there's ongoing re-run event.

However, the designing staff might reuse/carry the design language from previous edition they
participated.

## 🉑 Do I still have a chance to get cards if I sent request after request limit and/or after deadline?

**No**. Your request will be considered invalid.

# About: Limit

## 🛑 What is card limit?

A card limit is the maximum amount of cards a member can order/request from a particular designing
staff OR edition.

In default, The Newbie Club card limit is set to staff. But in some case, the limit is set
globally (applied to the edition).<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>

## ⛔ What is request limit?

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/businessman2_kangaechu.png" align="right" width="200">

Request limit is the maximum amount of replies/requests in an edition.

It is usually set to 100 requests per edition.

Please note that due to how MyAnimeList count replies, you can calculate by subtracting replies with
main/first post instead, and another 2<sup>nd</sup> post by poster, if any.

## 🆙 Why is the card limit for staff greater than regular member?

In short: they *work* for club, so it is absolutely understandable if they would like more cards
compared to regular members.

# About: Miscellaneous

## Suggestion

### 🗳️ What is edition suggestion?

Edition suggestion is suggestion to helps us which topic will be released next.

The suggestion field is open for everyone, including staff, and each of them are able to suggest one
topic/title per submission.

### ✍ Which one I can suggest to the team?

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/touhyou_man.png" width="200" align="right">

We accept anything\*!

You can suggest us **one** of your favorite anime/manga title, director, voice actors, event, or
even general topic. <!-- pun unintended, ngl. -->

Please note that the chances we picked specific director's/VA's works is very low, as we are more
embracing in introducing animanga and Japanese culture to newcomers.

\* *It should be inside ACG (Animation, Comic, Game) and Japanese culture.*

### 🙋‍♂️ Can I suggest more than one titles/subject in one reply/request?

Unfortunately, **no**. We want to be fair as possible and considering of this club's main purpose,
this is our approach for it.

### 🕔 How long will suggested edition take to be released?

Imagine like a *demand rate theory*, the more people want it (demand), the less time will take
for the edition to be released, thus the rate is greater.

Due to how we implement the system, it is a little bit different.

In TNC, there are three steps before the edition release, and it is happening after second edition
released to public:

1. Requesters suggested the editions up to minimum threshold.
   > Minimum threshold may vary by the general topic and/or audience of the suggestion is.
   >
   > If the suggested topic is about recurrence event, threshold will be skipped, and automatically
   > jumps to the second steps.
2. When the threshold is reached, it will be listed as an option for the inner team tally. As the
   club will hold 2 editions in every month, options in each tally is 4 up to 6.
3. Any staff of graphic designing and delivery team, deputies of each section, and admin of each
   section will decide which edition will be released. The most votes will be released on first
   week.
   > Also, staff might will not vote the suggestion even if the edition itself was suggested for
   > double or more times than minimum threshold.

As our suggestion list is growing faster, unfortunately it will take 5 months to a year if demand
rate is 0.5/month.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>

We want those suggestions were released completely, but considering the main purpose of the club
exist, it can't be helped. You might want to suggest your specific edition suggestion to another
club with their main purpose is collecting collectibles.

## Production

### 🎨 How do your team create the card?

We use Adobe Photoshop for our work, but it's not the requirement.

We allow staff to use other apps than Photoshop, like Affinity Designer, Krita, GIMP, Paint.NET,
ibisPaint, etc.

*Heck*, the GFX head himself <!--, @nattadasu, --> uses Microsoft Office PowerPoint to design his
cards, and barely no one noticed it.

### 🔎 Can I know the technical information to create card?

Sure!

We use this configuration for our cards:

* Allowed file format for card: PNG, A-PNG (Animated PNG), GIF, and JPEG. However, PNG is
  recommended.
* Ratio (orientation) can be landscape, portrait, or square (1:1).
* Resolution/size for card can not exceed, based on orientation:
  * Landscape: 360x240px (3:2).
  * Portrait: 240x360px (2:3).
  * Square: 240x240px (1:1).
    > **Note:**\
    > Create your card with twice of resolution on your draft, and then rescale it back. This
    > method is to avoid any visual lost after you created it.
* Recommended to use 300dpi, minimum 90dpi.
* Card should *at least* contains 3 (three) text fields/spaces:
  1. **Edition name**, e.g: "School Edition."
  2. **Club Name**, e.g: "The Newbie Club" or "TNC."
  3. **Username/Nickname**, This will be where we write the names of people who requested cards
     from the edition before delivering them.

<img src="../assets/irasutoya/original/ai_computer_sousa_robot.png" width="210" align="left">

### 🤖 Writing one-by-one requester's names seems very tedious, isn't there any automation to do it?

As you expect, **yes**, there is an automation method to ease the progress in creating cards.

However, this method is currently limited to Adobe Photoshop. We can't find any automation feature
or script for another program.
