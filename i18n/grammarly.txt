About: Cards
💳 What is a card?

Cards or card editions are a club thing that don’t serve a real purpose, but are rather collectibles that you can, for example, just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this example here, or display them on your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc.2

We don't have a definite answer on how it became a thing but it's in a lot of other clubs as well. This is just one of them.

Members collect them for these reasons:

Show off in a blog.
The sake of having a collection.
Admire the cards made by different designers.
The card design you will get is the same as what you requested, but with your username on it.3

✉️ How to get the cards?
Requesting a card is easy by following this step:


Check if the edition still open.
You can check it by looking up thread title. If it says [CLOSED] or [HALTED], then you're out of luck. ;-;

Read carefully the instruction and rules included on the edition.
These instructions will assist you on how to request the cards while abiding rules.

Copy the form provided on the edition thread.
In some cases, user required to not modify the template at all.

Go to the bottom/top of thread, and look for "Post New Reply" or "Quick Reply" button/link, and click it to reply.
Paste the form to the text box, and fill the form based what the instruction suggests.
Make sure total amount cards you requested for each staff is not exceeded from limit specified.

Submit the request.
You're done!
❓ What are those random text inside brackets?
Those are known as BBCode tags. Simply saying, those are instructions to tell MyAnimeList which text we want to format.

For example, if we want to make the text bold, we can do it by typing:

[b]bold[/b]
You can learn more about BBCode from:

The Newbie Club BBCode Guide
MyAnimeList's Official Formatting Tips
Shishio's BBCode Guide (with Video)
🤔 Can I remove some "questions" on the forms?

Short answer, no.

All of those questions, excluding comments, suggestion, and feedback (if any), are required in request form.

In The Newbie Club, the structure must stay as if, due to implementation on bot.

However, you can leave it blank as to avoid any conflict.

↩️ Can I get cards from previous edition?
No. It is not possible to get previous edition's cards, UNLESS if there's ongoing re-run event.

However, the designing staff might reuse/carry the design language from previous edition they participated.

🉑 Do I still have a chance to get cards if I sent request after request limit and/or after deadline?
No. Your request will be considered invalid.


About: Limit
🛑 What is card limit?
A card limit is the maximum amount of cards a member can order/request from a particular designing staff OR edition.

In default, The Newbie Club card limit is set to staff. But in some case, the limit is set globally (applied to the edition).4

You can see the limit specified by staff under their name, usually written as:

Samantha
Member: x/y
Staff: x/y

Or

Nicolas
Any: x/y

With x is amount of cards you can take, and y is total amount of card available.

⛔ What is request limit?

Request limit is the maximum amount of replies/requests in an edition.

It is usually set to 100 requests per edition.

Please note that due to how MyAnimeList count replies, you can calculate by subtracting replies with main/first post instead, and another 2nd post by poster, if any.

🆙 Why is the card limit for staff greater than regular member?
In short: they work for club, so it is absolutely understandable if they would like more cards compared to regular members.


About: Scheduling and Edition Theme
🗓️ When is usually an edition released?
We usually release the edition bi-weekly every 1st and 3rd week of the month in Sunday at 8:00 AM or 11:00 AM UTC/GMT+0.

However, we might not release for a week or even a month as to provide free time during holiday/vacation period.

⌚ How long the period for each edition release?
It is 5 days, counted from second of edition released and ended on Thursday, UNLESS under some circumstance.

🎨 Which theme The Newbie Club usually release for the card edition?
Due to club's nature, we are focusing in introducing animanga and Japanese culture to any newcomers.


About: Rules Enforcement
📕 What rules for requesting the cards, can you explain it?
In TNC, we have rules for both regular members and club staff to acknowledge and obey before requesting the cards.

Below are the rules of each edition and their definition (if required):

Request your cards by commenting on this forum thread and using a list number instead of naming the card.
This clause is self explanatory.

However, for "using a list number instead of naming the card," we saw some members named the card by featured figure on that card. This can result in ambiguity by bot, and the bot will ignore this as it assumes as comment.

Do not request cards if you have no intention of saving them AND/OR request for someone else.
This clause is self explanatory.

Please follow the format and respect the limits given by each card maker, or the request will be deleted.
Limit stated on this clause is card limit.

Due to our current automation limitation, do not change or remove query names. We will warn you if find any infringement.
In short, anything inside request template can not be deleted or modified. This behavior will affect our bot when fetching/taking data from forum thread to database.

If you want to claim additional card(s) using slip card AND/OR by requirement from designer, please use plus symbol (+) on additional card(s).
See Slip Card.

In cases where your username is long and ensure your name fits, it's advised to leave a short name/nickname no more than 12 characters/words.
Most of card designs have limited space for text field, usually only available around 12 characters.

Editions are limited to x requests, so it's first come, first served!
This clause is self explanatory.


⚠️ Why one of the staff sent me a warning to my PM?
We found an error on your request and/or did not obey the rules stated on the edition.

Your request were either edited to comply bot configuration by us OR deleted if there is exceeded amount of card request on particular staff.

🚶‍♂️ I saw someone bypassed the limit by adding plus (+), what is it?
They used slip card on their request. To learn more, see Slip Card.

🕵️‍♂️ I have issue with one or more cards, where I can speak to?
Please send a MAL PM to @nattadasu for further investigation.

🙅‍♂️ My content was being used without permission, where I can submit takedown request?
Please send a takedown request to dmca@nattadasu.my.id. We will try our best in taking down in day or earlier.

Unfortunately due to the club does not have its dedicated email address for moment.


About: Delivery and Usage
🚛 When I can get my cards?
Usually designer required a week or more to finish all of request, upload the files, and distribute the cards one-by-one to each requesters.

It is indeed taking a lot of time for designer to do it by theirselves, so we facilitated by adding new subsection: card deliverer.

However, in some case, designer unable to finish it in a week and probably will take months to finish due to works they need to finish first.

Keep in note that most of our club staff are teenagers and undergrad students, and we focus more in our education.

😢 What do I do when I didn't receive the card?
Before filing a complaint, please check Card Delivery Tracking thread and read instructions stated on the thread.

By it status:

If the status of designer is 🎨 designing, and it is less than 2 months after thread closed:
Please wait.

If the status of designer is 🎨 designing, and it is more than or equal to 2 months after thread closed:
Send a MAL PM to @nattadasu.

If the status of designer is ✅ delivered, but did not received the card:
Send a MAL PM to respective designer.

If the status of designer is ❌ halted:
Send a MAL PM to @nattadasu.

🖼 Where can I put the cards?
As we stated earlier on 💳 What is card, you can put it whereever you want!

You can put it on your MAL Blog, Profile Bio, or even created separated website just for album.


About: Signature Shortcut
🔗 Can I ask the deliverer to lookup delivery link on my forum signature?
Yes, you can! But we still recommend you to at least hyperlink "LIS"/"Blog Post" to your respective delivery blog instead.

📜 Is there any guideline for it?
We do have guides for it, but most likely it is a common sense or give the designer/deliverer more accessibility.

If you interested to know more, read the guide below:

Link should be on the left side of signature content.
If link to blog was hyperlinked into signature image:
If you have multiple hyperlinked images, you must explicitly state which one is the correct link by adding text into the image itself OR you can state the location of the link on comment query.
If you only have one image, you are not required to state the location.
Link to blog that hyperlinked into text must:
Visible by any background, white and dark.
Lightness of the color must not below 25% and above 90%.

Avoid font size below 40% of MyAnimeList's 13px.
Avoid any fancy font style to ensure Unicode compability on designer/deliverer end machine.

About: Suggestion
🗳️ What is edition suggestion?
Edition suggestion is suggestion to helps us which topic will be released next.

The suggestion field is open for everyone, including staff, and each of them are able to suggest one topic/title per submission.

✍ Which one I can suggest to the team?

We accept anything!5

You can suggest us one of your favorite anime/manga title, director, voice actors, event, or even general topic.
Please note that the chances we picked specific director's/VA's works is very low, as we are more embracing in introducing animanga and Japanese culture to newcomers.

🙋‍♂️ Can I suggest more than one titles/subject in one reply/request?
Unfortunately, no. We want to be fair as possible and considering of this club's main purpose, this is our approach for it.

🕔 How long will suggested edition take to be released?
Imagine like a demand rate theory, the more people want it (demand), the less time will take for the edition to be released, thus the rate is greater.

Due to how we implement the system, it is a little bit different.

In TNC, there are three steps before the edition release, and it is happening after second edition released to public:

Requesters suggested the editions up to minimum threshold.
Minimum threshold may vary by the general topic and/or audience of the suggestion is.

If the suggested topic is about recurrence event, threshold will be skipped, and automatically jumps to the second steps.

When the threshold is reached, it will be listed as an option for the inner team tally. As the club will hold 2 editions in every month, options in each tally is 4 up to 6.
Any staff of graphic designing and delivery team, deputies of each section, and admin of each section will decide which edition will be released. The most votes will be released on first week.
Also, staff might will not vote the suggestion even if the edition itself was suggested for double or more times than minimum threshold.

As our suggestion list is growing faster, unfortunately it will take 5 months to a year if demand rate is 0.5/month.5

We want those suggestions were released completely, but considering the main purpose of the club exist, it can't be helped. You might want to suggest your specific edition suggestion to another club with their main purpose is collecting collectibles.


About: Miscellaneous
Production

🖌️ How do your team create the card?
We use Adobe Photoshop for our work, but it's not the requirement.

We allow staff to use other apps than Photoshop, like Affinity Designer, Krita, GIMP, Paint.NET, ibisPaint, etc.

Heck, the GFX head himself uses Microsoft Office PowerPoint to design his cards, and barely no one noticed it.

🔎 Can I know the technical information to create card?
Sure!

We use this configuration for our cards:

Allowed file format for card: PNG, A-PNG (Animated PNG), GIF, and JPEG. However, PNG is recommended.
Ratio (orientation) can be landscape, portrait, or square (1:1).
Resolution/size for card can not exceed, based on orientation:
Landscape: 360x240px (3:2).
Portrait: 240x360px (2:3).
Square: 240x240px (1:1).
Note:
Create your card with twice of resolution on your draft, and then rescale it back. This method is to avoid any visual lost after you created it.

Recommended to use 300dpi, minimum 90dpi.
Card should at least contains 3 (three) text fields/spaces:
Edition name, e.g: "School Edition."
Club Name, e.g: "The Newbie Club" or "TNC."
Username/Nickname, This will be where we write the names of people who requested cards from the edition before delivering them.
If you want to learn more, visit The Newbie Club's GFX Encyclopedia.


🤖 Writing one-by-one requester's names seems very tedious, isn't there any automation to do it?
As you expect, yes, there is an automation method to ease the progress in creating cards.

However, this method is currently limited to Adobe Photoshop. We can't find any automation feature or script for another program.

If you want to learn more, visit The Newbie Club's GFX Encyclopedia.

Slip card
➕ What is slip card?

A slip card is a card that allows requesters to bypass the limit with specified amount on the card itself. Basically the slip card is like loyalty/membership cards applied on stores.

The reason why it exist is unclear, but by looking the pattern of usage, it become clear:

The requester is regular customer.
The requester adores the design made by particular staff.
They just likes to collect cards.
On TNC, you can attach your slip card into your request by adding image inside spoiler box, and then explicitly stating on request if they own slip card by adding addition (+) symbol to cards.

For example:

[...]
Natsu: 1, 3 + 5, 7 [spoiler="slip card"][img]https://i.imgur.com/CqaSw61.png[/img][/spoiler]
Above code snippet will be rendered as:

Natsu: 1, 3 + 5, 7

Show slip card
📬 How to get slip card?
You can get the slip card by checking designer's profile. Club does not provide first party slip card store, and you must check it manually.

To ease the progress, check any links given by designer/deliverer in their delivery message if they have slip card store store.
