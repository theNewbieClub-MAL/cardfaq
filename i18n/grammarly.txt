About: Cards
💳 What is a card?

Cards or card editions are a club thing that doesn't serve a real purpose but are rather collectibles that you can, for example, just save, show off in a blog post on MAL such as in this example here, or display them on your MAL profile, your forum signature, etc.2

We don't have a definite answer on how it became a thing, but it's in many other clubs as well; this is just one of them.

Members collect them for these reasons:

Show off in a blog.
The sake of having a collection.
Admire the cards made by different designers.
The card design you will get is the same as what you requested, but with your username on it.3

✉️ How to get the cards?
Requesting a card is easy by following this step:


Check if the edition is still open.
You can check it by looking up the thread title. If it says [CLOSED] or [HALTED], then you're out of luck. ;-;

Read carefully the instruction and rules included in the edition.
These instructions will assist you in requesting the cards while abiding by the rules.

Copy the form provided on the edition thread.
In some cases, the user is required not to modify the template.

Go to the bottom/top of the thread, look for the "Post New Reply" or "Quick Reply" button/link, and click it to reply.
Paste the form to the text box, and fill the form based on what the instruction suggests.
Make sure the total amount cards you requested for each staff is not exceeded the limit specified.

Submit the request.
You're done!
❓ What are those random texts inside brackets?
Those are known as BBCode tags. Simply saying, those are instructions to tell MyAnimeList which text we want to format.

For example, if we want to make the text bold, we can do it by typing:

[b]bold[/b]
You can learn more about BBCode from:

The Newbie Club BBCode Guide
MyAnimeList's Official Formatting Tips
Shishio's BBCode Guide (with Video)
🤔 Can I remove some "questions" on the forms?

Short answer, no.

All of those questions, excluding comments, suggestions, and feedback (if any), are required in the request form.

In The Newbie Club, the structure must stay as if due to implementation on the bot.

However, you can leave it blank to avoid any conflict.

↩️ Can I get cards from the previous edition?
No. It is impossible to get previous edition's cards, UNLESS if there's an ongoing re-run event.

However, the designing staff might reuse/carry the design language from the previous edition.

🉑 Do I still have a chance to get the card if I send the request after the request limit and/or after the deadline?
No. Your request will be considered invalid.


About: Limit
🛑 What is the card limit?
A card limit is a maximum amount of cards a member can order/request from an individual designing staff OR edition.

In default, The Newbie Club card limit is set to staff. But in some cases, the limit is set globally (applied to the edition).4

You can see the limit specified by staff under their name, usually written as:

Samantha
Member: x/y
Staff: x/y

Or

Nicolas
Any: x/y

With x is the number of cards you can take, and y is the total number of cards available.

⛔ What is the request limit?

Request limit is the maximum amount of replies/requests in an edition.

It is usually set to 100 requests per edition.

Please note that due to how MyAnimeList counts replies, you can calculate by subtracting replies with main/first post instead and another 2nd post by poster, if any.

🆙 Why is the card limit for staff greater than regular members?
In short: they work for TNC, so it is understandable if they would like more cards compared to regular members.


About: Scheduling and Edition Theme
🗓️ When is usually an edition released?
We usually release the edition bi-weekly every 1st and 3rd week of the month on Sunday at 8:00 AM, or 11:00 AM UTC/GMT+0.

However, we might not release for a week or even a month to provide free time during the holiday/vacation period.

⌚ How long is the period for each edition release?
It is five days, counted from the second edition released and ended on Thursday, UNLESS under some circumstance.

🎨 Which theme does The Newbie Club usually release for the card edition?
Due to the club's nature, we are focusing on introducing animanga and Japanese culture to any newcomers.


About: Rules Enforcement
📕 What rules for requesting the cards? Can you explain it?
In TNC, we have rules for regular members and club staff to acknowledge and obey before requesting the cards.

Below are the rules of each edition and their definition (if required):

Request your cards by commenting on this forum thread and using a list number instead of naming the card.
This clause is self-explanatory.

However, for "using a list number instead of naming the card," we saw some members called the card by the featured figure on that card. This can result in ambiguity by the bot, and the bot will ignore this as it assumes as a comment.

Do not request cards if you have no intention of saving them AND/OR request for someone else.
This clause is self-explanatory.

Please follow the format and respect the limits given by each card maker, or the request will be deleted.
The limit stated in this clause is the card limit.

Due to our current automation limitation, do not change or remove query names. We will warn you if find any infringement.
In short, anything inside the request template can not be deleted or modified. This behavior will affect our bot when fetching/taking data from a forum thread to a database.

If you want to claim additional card(s) using slip card AND/OR by requirement from designer, please use plus symbol (+) on additional card(s).
See Slip Card.

In cases where your username is long and ensure your name fits, it's advised to leave a short name/nickname no more than 12 characters/words.
Most card designs have limited space for text fields, usually only around 12 characters.

Editions are limited to x requests, so it's first-come, first served!
This clause is self-explanatory.


⚠️ Why did one of the staff send me a warning to my PM?
We found an error on your request and/or did not obey the rules stated in the edition.

Your request was either edited to comply with bot configuration by us OR deleted if there is exceeded amount of card requests on individual staff.

🚶‍♂️ I saw someone bypassed the limit by adding plus (+), what is it?
They used a slip card on their request. To learn more, see Slip Card.

🕵️‍♂️ I have an issue with one or more cards, where I can speak to?
Please send a MAL PM to @nattadasu for further investigation.

🙅‍♂️ My content was being used without permission; where I can submit a takedown request?
Please send a takedown request to dmca@nattadasu.my.id. We will try our best to take it down in a day or earlier.

Unfortunately, the club does not have its dedicated email address for a moment.


About: Delivery and Usage
🚛 When can I get my cards?
Usually designer requires a week or more to finish all of the requests, upload the files, and distribute the cards one by one to each requester.

It is indeed taking much time for the designer to do it by themselves, so we facilitated by adding a new subsection: card deliverer.

However, in some cases, the designer cannot finish it in a week and probably will take months to finish due to works they need to finish first.

Note that most of our club staff are teenagers and undergrad students, and we focus more on our education.

😢 What did I do when I didn't receive the card?
Before filing a complaint, please check the Card Delivery Tracking thread and read the instructions stated on the thread.

By it status:

If the status of the designer is 🎨 designing, and it is less than two months after the thread closed:
Please wait.

If the status of the designer is 🎨 designing, and it is more than or equal to 2 months after the thread closed:
Send a MAL PM to @nattadasu.

If the status of the designer is ✅ delivered, but did not receive the card:
Send a MAL PM to the respective designer.

If the status of the designer is ❌ halted:
Send a MAL PM to @nattadasu.

🖼 Where can I put the cards?
As stated earlier on 💳 What is a card, you can put it wherever you want!

You can put it on your MAL Blog, Profile Bio, or even create a separate website just for the album.


About: Signature Shortcut
🔗 Can I ask the deliverer to look up the delivery link on my forum signature?
Yes, you can! But we still recommend you to at least hyperlink "LIS"/"Blog Post" to your respective delivery blog instead.

📜 Is there any guideline for it?
We do have guides for it, but it is most likely common sense or gives the designer/deliverer more accessibility.

If you are interested to know more, read the guide below:

The link should be on the left side of the signature content.
If the link to the blog was hyperlinked into the signature image:
If you have multiple hyperlinked images, you must explicitly state which one is the correct link by adding text into the image itself, OR you can state the link's location on the comment query.
If you only have one image, you are not required to state the location.
Link to blog that hyperlinked into text must:
Visible by any background, white and dark.
The lightness of the color must not be below 25% and above 90%.

Avoid font size below 40% of MyAnimeList's 13px.
Avoid any fancy font style to ensure Unicode compatibility on the designer/deliverer end machine.

About: Suggestion
🗳️ What is the edition suggestion?
Edition suggestion is a suggestion to help us which topic will be released next.

The suggestion field is open for everyone, including staff, and each of them can suggest one topic/title per submission.

✍ Which one can I suggest to the team?

We accept anything!5

You can suggest one of your favorite anime/manga titles, director, voice actors, event, or even general topics.
Please note that the chances we picked specific director's/VA's works are very low, as we are more embracing in introducing animanga and Japanese culture to newcomers.

🙋‍♂️ Can I suggest more than one title/subject in one reply/request?
Unfortunately, no. We want to be fair as possible, and considering this club's primary purpose, this is our approach.

🕔 How long will the suggested edition take to be released?
Imagine a demand rate theory; the more people want it (demand), the less time will take for the edition to be released; thus, the rate is greater.

Due to how we implement the system, it is a little bit different.

In TNC, there are three steps before the edition release, and it is happening after the second edition is released to the public:

Requesters suggested the editions up to the minimum threshold.
The minimum threshold may vary by the general topic and/or audience of the suggestion is.

If the suggested topic is about a recurrence event, the threshold will be skipped and automatically jump to the second step.

When the threshold is reached, it will be listed as an option for the internal team tally. As the club will hold two editions every month, votes in each tally are 4 up to 6.
Any staff of the graphic designing and delivery team, deputies of each section, and admin of each section will decide which edition will be released. The most votes will be released in the first week.
Also, staff might not vote the suggestion even if the edition itself was suggested double or more times than the minimum threshold.

As our suggestion list is growing faster, unfortunately, it will take five months to a year if the demand rate is 0.5/month.5

We want those suggestions to be released ultimately, but considering the club's primary purpose exists, it can't be helped. You might like to suggest your specific edition suggestion to another club whose primary purpose is collecting collectibles.


About: Miscellaneous
Production

🖌️ How do your team create the card?
We use Adobe Photoshop for our work, but it's not required.

We allow staff to use apps other than Photoshop, like Affinity Designer, Krita, GIMP, Paint.NET, ibisPaint, etc.

Heck, the GFX head himself uses Microsoft Office PowerPoint to design his cards, and barely anyone noticed it.

🔎 Can I know the technical information to create a card?
Sure!

We use this configuration for our cards:
Allowed file formats for the card: PNG, A-PNG (Animated PNG), GIF, and JPEG. However, PNG is recommended.
Ratio (orientation) can be landscape, portrait, or square (1:1).
Resolution/size for the card can not exceed, based on orientation:
Landscape: 360x240px (3:2).
Portrait: 240x360px (2:3).
Square: 240x240px (1:1).
Note:
Create your card with twice of resolution on your draft, and then rescale it back. This method is to avoid any visual loss after you create it.

Recommended using 300dpi, minimum 90dpi.
The card should at least contains 3 (three) text fields/spaces:
Edition name, e.g., "School Edition."
Club Name, e.g., "The Newbie Club" or "TNC."
Username/Nickname, This will be where we write the names of people who requested cards from the edition before delivering them.
Visit The Newbie Club's GFX Encyclopedia if you want to learn more.


🤖 Writing one-by-one requester's names looks pretty tedious; isn't there any automation to do it?
As you expect, yes, there is an automation method to ease creating cards.

However, this method is currently limited to Adobe Photoshop. We can't find any automation feature or script for another program.

Visit The Newbie Club's GFX Encyclopedia if you want to learn more.

Slip card
➕ What is a slip card?

A slip card is a card that allows requesters to bypass the limit with the specified amount on the card itself. The slip card is like loyalty/membership cards applied on stores.

The reason why it exists is unclear, but by looking at the pattern of usage, it becomes clear:

The requester is a regular customer.
The requester adores the design made by individual staff.
They just like to collect cards.
On TNC, you can attach your slip card to your request by adding an image inside the spoiler box and then explicitly stating on request if they own a slip card by adding an addition (+) symbol to cards.

For example:

[...]
Natsu: 1, 3 + 5, 7 [spoiler="slip card"][img]https://i.imgur.com/CqaSw61.png[/img][/spoiler]
The above code snippet will be rendered as:

Natsu: 1, 3 + 5, 7

Show slip card
📬 How to get a slip card?
You can get the slip card by checking the designer's profile. The club does not provide a first-party slip card store, and you must check it manually.

To ease the progress, check any links given by the designer/deliverer in their delivery message if they have a slip card store.
