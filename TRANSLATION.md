# Translation Guide

Thanks for your interest in translating this doc!

Before getting started, it is recommended to learn about Markdown and HTML in general to understand
what happening on [i18n/en_US.md](i18n/en_US.md).

You can learn Markdown from:

* [Learn Markdown](https://learn-markdown.github.io)
* [Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

...and HTML from:

* [HTML Tutorial by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
* [HTML Tags Reference by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
* [HTML.com](https://html.com)

Then, we recommend you to use [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as most
of configurations and plugins were set up there. 😔

  > **Example:**
  > | Original | Indonesian |
  > | :------: | :--------: |
  > | 1:00 PM UTC/GMT+0 | 13.00 UTC/GMT+0 (20.00 WIB) |
* In any links that redirect to a page using foreign language, it is wise to describe what language
  used in the link.
